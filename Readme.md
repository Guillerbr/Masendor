Medieval battle simulation game made with Pygame. There is no main name for the game but rather the name will be based on major update.

Plan

Ver 0.1: Core Mechanic and simple UI

Ver 0.2: Expand core mechanic to increase unit complexity

Ver 0.3: More complex control and UI function

Ver 0.4: Game map, terrain and camera (Going to be somewhat difficult and long to implement)

Ver 0.5: Optimise for larger battle (Also proper code documentation + formal structure)

Ver 0.6: Battle selection, preparation and result screen

Ver 0.7: In game art and better looking UI (All hand (and mouse) drawn only except for historical image)

Ver 0.8: Sound effect and ingame music (May need to use royalty free music since I have no experience in music)

Ver 0.9: more complex AI (The most challenging step unless cut corner to the point of braindead AI)
