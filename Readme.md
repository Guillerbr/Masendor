Medieval battle simulation game made with Pygame. There is no main name for the game but rather the name will be based on major update. 
The current code structure and documentation follows no standard guideline whatsoever, so read and confuse at your own risk (until ver 0.5).

Plan

Ver 0.2: Expand core mechanic to increase unit complexity

2.7: battalion command (raise flag,forced march,decimation,duel,change skill usage,change stance,transfer leader?)

2.8: commander, strategist and battalion surrender function 

2.9: equipment quality, unit card stat for equipment, another base stat rework

Ver 0.3: Game map, terrain and camera (Going to be somewhat difficult and long to implement)

Ver 0.4: More complex UI function (Event log, popup box), also weather effect and finalise melee combat engagement and collision

Ver 0.5: Optimise for larger battle (Also proper code documentation + structure) as the saying goes, just because it works does not mean it is optimised

Ver 0.6: Battle selection, preparation and result screen, custom battle

Ver 0.7: In game art and better looking UI (All hand (and mouse) drawn except for historical image)

Ver 0.8: Sound effect and ingame music (May need to use royalty free music since I have no experience in music)

Ver 0.9: more complex AI (The most challenging step unless cut corner to the point of braindead AI)
