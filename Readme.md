Medieval battle simulation game made with Pygame. There is no main name for the game but rather the name will be based on major update. 
The current code structure and documentation follows no standard guideline whatsoever, so read and confuse at your own risk (until ver 0.5).

Plan

Ver 0.2: Expand core mechanic to increase unit complexity

2.5: detach/split battalion

2.6: Leader squad and personal stat+combat dmg chance (Also more dynamic authority based on leader squad position)

2.7: battalion command (raise flag,forced march,decimation,duel,change skill usage,change stance)

2.8: commander and strategist function

2.9: equipment quality, unit card stat for equipment, another base stat rework

Ver 0.3: Game map, terrain and camera (Going to be somewhat difficult and long to implement, moved from 0.4 as the ui function will need to be reword to work with movable display anywya)

Ver 0.4: More complex UI function (Event log, popup box), also weather effect (moved from 0.3)

Ver 0.5: Optimise for larger battle (Also proper code documentation + structure) as the saying goes, just because it works does not mean it is optimised

Ver 0.6: Battle selection, preparation and result screen

Ver 0.7: In game art and better looking UI (All hand (and mouse) drawn except for historical image)

Ver 0.8: Sound effect and ingame music (May need to use royalty free music since I have no experience in music)

Ver 0.9: more complex AI (The most challenging step unless cut corner to the point of braindead AI)
