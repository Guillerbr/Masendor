Historical battle simulation game made with Pygame. There is no main name for the game but rather the name will be based on major update. 
The current code structure and documentation follows no standard guideline whatsoever, so read and confuse at your own risk (until ver 0.5).

Plan

Ver 0.3 The World at Hand: Game map, terrain,mini map and camera (Going to be somewhat difficult and long to implement)

Ver 0.4 Window of Insight: More complex UI function (Event log, popup box), Dramatic Text based on important event at the center top of screen, also weather effect and finalise melee combat engagement and collision, changable game speed

Ver 0.5 Preparation for Chaos: Optimise for larger battle (Also proper code documentation + structure) as the saying goes, just because it works does not mean it is optimised

Ver 0.6 Dream Decision: Battle selection, preparation and result screen, custom battle

Ver 0.7 Future Visionary: Fog of War, hidden stat, line of sight, battalion information based on hidden vs sight, raise flag/ light torch and recon command, ambush bonus

Ver 0.8 Authentic Attraction: In game art and better looking UI (All hand (and mouse) drawn except for historical image)

Ver 0.9 Gaze of New Life: more complex AI (The most challenging step unless cut corner to the point of braindead AI)

Ver 1 Pax Paradisum: historical battle simulation game

Ver 1 - 1.5: More art, sound effect and ingame music (May need to use royalty free music since I have no experience in music) + Ingame Encyclopedia at main menu + more historical battle

Ver 1.2: Siege battle, more complex unit equipment (main hand/off hand, item, mount)

Ver 1.6: Commander, strategist and leader duel with dynamic result and event (Move from 0.2.7 as it is not main priority in the early battle sample yet), transfer leader

ver 1.7: leader rapport and affect on authority and control mechanic including surrender and betrayal 

Ver 1.8: Deployable Defence (Stakes, Barrier, Camp, Wagon, ), dynamic squad facing position and maybe "saved" formation that player can rotate in battle 

Unforeseenable future: forced march (Moved here from 0.2.7 as this feature won't be much used until game map become much larger than just a single battlefield)
