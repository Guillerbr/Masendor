0,Modern Historians,"10,000 vs 7,000",0,1,1,0,"Modern Historians, using estimation from the logistic probability and population of both England and Normandy at the time, came to the conclusion that both of the armies likely have between 7,000 to 14,000 troops each. With Haroldâ€™s army being the smaller one. The exact number is still inconclusive as each historian provides a varied number based on their reasoning."
1,William of Poitiers,"60,000 vs 80,000",0,6,9,0,"William of Poitiers was a French chronicler who wrote a record of the Invasion of England around a decade after. This record named ""Gesta Guillelmi"" provides detailed information of the event, albeit very likely in the favour of the Norman. The record claims that Harold's army was actually the larger one of the two, although with no exact number provided. While William the conqueror's army had 50,000 in France and 60,000 troops before the battle."
