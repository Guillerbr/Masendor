Norman army very likely employed lines of spearmen at the front to counter the enemy cavalries' charge. It may be possible that Harold Godwinson knew of this fact and it was one of the factors that caused him to order his cavalries to dismount before the Battle of Hastings commenced and concentrate on defensive tactic instead of senseless charge.
