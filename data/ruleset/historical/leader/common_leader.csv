10001,"Thane",1000,40,4,4,2,5,4,2,"Saxon thane (or thegn) is the landowner, which is considered to be a minor noble title in Saxon England. Thanes are responsible for governing their local land and raising the militia (fyrd) to respond to the call of war by their king.

10002,"Minor Noble",1000,50,4,3,4,5,4,0,"In the time of inefficient record, it is impossible to keep track the name of every person who was the leader of the army units let alone participated in the battle. History oftentimes remembers only the major nobles who were the top in the chain of command, but it is important to know that no army can be led by such a few individuals even for an organised mass. These minor nobles were one of such people that often joined their lord army as a minor leader or warrior."
10003,"Noble",1000,60,5,5,5,5,4,0,"Not even an important noble would be assuredly recorded in the chronicle of a battle in the time of pre-industrialisation period. The majority of battles in world history did not have historians to record the event or its existence as the well-known battles we know today, some may even be lost to the flow time, accident or intentional erasing. These unnamed nobles still without a doubt aided their sovereign as commanders of the contingent in the battle."
