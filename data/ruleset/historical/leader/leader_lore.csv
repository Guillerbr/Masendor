2,"William of house Normandy, an illegitimate son of Robert I the Magnificent (hence the nickname “the Bastard”), was born around 1027. He became the Duke of Normandy at the age of 8 but his rise was nothing short of challenging due to his birth status. Many nobles attempted to gain custody of the young duke or organise rebellions to seize the dukedom. With the support of King Henry I of France and many prominent nobles, William managed to consolidate the region of Normandy under his rule in the end.","William first experience in warfare began in the Battle of Varaville, 1047, against a rebellion led by Guy of Burgundy and the fellow conspirators. With the support of King Henry I who personally raised an army of 10,000 strongs to support William's much smaller army, they managed to win against the less organised rebel army, while being outnumbered by at least 2 to 1. The battle ended prematurely after the rebel army became disheartened after losing multiple cavalry skirmishes and broken apart.","After crushing the rebels in the Battle of Varaville, William continuously removed those who threaten his rule in a series of battles and sieges. After his rule of Normandy was firmly in place, William never stop expanding his influence, which ultimately caused great concern to both the French King, Henry I, and his court. Thus, Henry I and multiple French and Norman nobles marched to seize control of Normandy. Two invasions were attempted which result in the Battle of Mortemer in 1054 and Battle of Varaville in 1057.","With Normandy now under his control, William expanded his control even further with the Invasion of Brittany in 1064, only two years before the England invasion. Although the exact purpose of this invasion is not recorded, William managed to secure the border and also gained many Breton allies who will assist in the upcoming invasion. Additionally, it is with this invasion that multiple Norman sided sources claim Harold Godwinson assisted William in the invasion and promised to help him secure the throne of England.","Edward the Confessor recently passed away in 1066 and Harold proclaimed himself as King of England. William, who also claim to receive such blessing from King Edward, prepared an invasion to claim his rightful throne. Two war councils were called to plan the invasion and multiple prominent rulers at the time seem to support the invasion including the pope himself. William's army was assembled and the fleet was constructed in Normandy. ","Interestingly, the initial beginning of the invasion did not go well, the strong wind caused a major delay to the invasion, loss of fleet portion and decrease in the morale. This misfortune, however, creates a significant adventurous turn of event for William as King Harald of Norway arrived a few days earlier at Northumbrian coast. This cause Harold to march his army up north to deal with the Norwegian invasion and allows William's force to land safely at Pevensey Bay with plenty of time to recuperate.","IMAGE:\data\ruleset\historical\leader\lore_image\william_1.png","                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Picture: William holding a feast after fleet landing.","In the Battle of Hastings, William positioned his Conroi knights contingent behind the frontline during the initial phase of the battle. It is very likely that in the melee phase in mid-day that he personally led the charge into the enemy infantry line. If the chronicle to be believed, William was unhorsed and almost got killed multiple times in battle, which can be the cause of rumour of his death among the troop. At the end of the day, William managed to win against all odds and came out victorious. ","IMAGE:\data\ruleset\historical\leader\lore_image\william_2.png","Picture: William in battle openning his                                        helmet to prove that he was still alive                                       and rally his men.","After the battle, William marched his army to London while also spreading his force to crush the remaining Saxon resistance around the country. Upon reaching London, William ordered the construction of the Tower of London to fortified the capital. He was coronated as the king of England at Westminster Abbey on Christmas day 1066.  The English throne would then no longer be a dream but a reality. Thus marked the end of Saxon influence in England and the Norman conquest.","With William as now king, he replaced the old Saxon law and culture with the Norman one. Many former Saxon nobles were replaced with those who accompanied William in the invasion. Unsurprisingly, many remaining Saxon nobles would continue the resistance for the years to come. Even worse, King Sweyn II of Denmark supported the rebellion and mobilised his army for invasion. The resistance would continue for no less than two more decades after the end of conquest.","William's ruling over England is not much different from his prior approach in Normandy. The constant internal conflicts, rebellion and left the country in a constant state of warfare. Not only that, many of his campaigns were considered to be genocidal in nature by many scholars today, though not really uncommon in the Medieval era. Nevertheless, his military achievement is no doubt one of the deservingly critical acclaimed by historians today.","His story did not conclude elegantly even in his death. His lifeless body went rotten before the burial ceremony, and it swelled up to the point that it exploded when stuffed inside the coffin. His throne also did not pass on peacefully for succession rebellion between his two sons occurred only one year after, and the rule of his son (Rufus, the one who won) too ended tragically with an arrow to the chest.",
3,"Alan Rufus (the Red), son of Eudon (Odo) of Brittany and Orguen, was born around 1040 in Brittany. He was from House of Rennes and a relative of William the Bastard. Evident records seem to suggest that Alan was William's companion and held a sizable amount of lands and estates long before the Invasion of England. However not much else is known about Rufus in his early life before the Battle of Hastings but much of his legacies still live on to this day.","IMAGE:\data\ruleset\historical\leader\lore_image\alan_1.png","                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Picture: William the Conqueror granting the charter with a green pendant seal representing lordship of Richmondshire to Alan Rufus.","Alan's accomplishment in the Battle of Hastings was noteworthy indeed. He was a commander for one of the Breton contingents, probably the infantry lines, and he was commended for merit in battle by various chronicles. For his contribution to the battle, Alan was greatly rewarded with a vast amount of wealth and lands in central England similar to other William's prominent companions. Alan remained a loyal subject of the Norman English throne until the end. ","After the invasion, Alan participated in the quelling of the Saxon rebellion in 1069. Although unclear what kind of role he had in the conflict, Alan was rewarded Honour of Richmond, the region of Yorkshire. There Alan built Richmond Castle in 1071 that still stands to this day, albeit as a ruin that reflects only the glory of its former self. As time went by, Alan's wealth and power grew larger. By 1086, Alan Rufus was one of the wealthiest and powerful individuals in England. ","IMAGE:\data\ruleset\historical\leader\lore_image\alan_2.png","             ","Picture: Watercolour of Richmond Castle in the late 18th century, by Paul Sandby and William Taverner.","In the later part of his life, Alan participated in various internal conflict and rebellion on the side of the royal throne. Even in the rebellion in 1088, Alan supported William II to protect the throne against Robert Curthose, William's eldest son. Victorious in various battles and contributed greatly to the war effort, Alan remained powerful in the English court, possibly only second to the king himself, unlike many other former companions of William.","Alan Rufus died suddenly and somewhat mysteriously either in 1090 or 1093 of unknown cause. His body was buried in an abbey at Bury St Edmunds, an eventful region on its own. Without children, Alan's brother, Alan Niger (the Black), inherited the title and treasure of the wealthiest individual in English history and remained as the second lord until his too inevitable death.",,,,,,
4,"William FitzOsbern was born in 1020, son of Osbern the seneschal of Normandy and Emma of Ivry. His family served the Duke of Normandy for generations and was a closed relative to the House of Normandy. With his father murdered in 1040, William FitzOsbern became the next seneschal for William the Bastard and one of the closest advisors to the duke. It is believed that being the most zealous supporter for the Invasion of England, he was the one that persuaded the opposition nobles to join the invasion.","With the successful conquest and as one of the leading figures in the invasion, William FitzOsbern was generously rewarded and granted the lordship over Isle of Wight and Hereford to already many of land-ownership under his rule. The promise of peace is still not in sight for England as the region near Wales (commonly called The Welsh Marches) was still under threat from the hostile Welsh Kingdom, William FitzOsbern was assigned as the chief strategist to create a new type of stone castle to defend the border.","IMAGE:\data\ruleset\historical\leader\lore_image\ozborn_1.png","                                                                                                                                                                                               Many stone castles did he build and still standing until this day, William became one of the major Norman castle builders. One of them being Chepstow Castle in the southeast of Wales, which is now the oldest stone castle that is still standing today in Britain as seen in the picture above.","William became one of the most prominent political figures in the Norman court. He was assigned the commander of the royal army and in charge of many regions, both as the regents and governor. The tales of this famed castle builder does not have a pleasant ending however as William saw an opportunity over the now contesting Flenders region. He decided to marry the widowed countess Richilde and rushed to her aid in the succession dispute conflict.","William joined the Battle of Cassel with a group of Norman Conrois against Robert I of Flenders in February 1071. Both Arnulf III, the leader of the army, and William were killed in the surprise attack organised by Robert. His estates and wealth were then divided among his two sons, William and Roger FitzOsbern.",,,,,,,,,,
5,"Eustace II (Nickname Eustace with moustaches) was born between the year 1015 and 1018, son of Eustace I of Boulogne and Matilda of Louvaine. He participated in the failed rebellion in 1033 against Henry III, emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, and was excommunicated by Pope Leo IX in 1049 for marrying his second wife, Ida of Lorraine, a close relative to Eustace after his first wife died a decade ago. Eustace also became the Count of Boulogne as his father died in the same year.","In 1051, Eustace visited Edward the confessor who was his relative and ally. A simple visit created a turn of event when Eustace and his retinue somehow got into a brawl with the people of Dovers. A minor event that led to the rebellion and exile of House Godwinson later on. Eustace joined Duke William of Normandy in the Invasion of England and seem to be one of the important commanders in the army. His role in the battle was noteworthy in many chronicles.","IMAGE:\data\ruleset\historical\leader\lore_image\eustace_1.png","                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Picture: Eustace in the battle pointing at Duke William and yelling to the troop that William is still here and alive.","As the battle turning worse for Norman side, the Norman record writes that as Eustace was about to retreat with his knights, Duke William's reinforcement arrived at the central engagement. Eustace advised the Duke that the army should withdraw but was ignored. As the fight continued, Eustace was struck in the face by a Saxon soldier that caused blood to gushed from his mouth and nose. Nevertheless, Eustace survived the battle.","Although Eustace joined William in the invasion, many pieces of evidence seem to suggest that this is not out of loyalty and friendship. It is also possible that Eustace looked down on William for being a bastard with commoner blood, while he was part of the illustrated House of Flenders. This matter reinforces the fact that Eustace's role in battle varied widely in different chronicles, some depict him as a coward while some others depict him as a competent warrior and commander.","After the invasion, Eustace was granted reward and land for his contribution to the invasion and returned to his holding in Boulogne. In 1067, Eustace launched an attack on Odo of Bayeux's castle in Dover, which ultimately failed. The reason for the attack is not clear, some suggested that it is rebellion for him being unsatisfied with the amount of reward from the invasion, while others suggest he was ""requested"" by his Englishmen allies who also joined the siege.","Eustace managed to flee from the failed rebellion back to Boulogne. He was stripped of his title and lordship in England when William heard of the rebellion. William later forgave Eustace and returned some of the confiscated lands soon later. Many scholars also suggest that it was Eustace who commisioned the Bayeux Tepastry and presented it to Odo of Bayeux to make amend for trying to attack Dover castle. This would explained why Eustace was depicted positively in the Tepastry.","Eustace remained a powerful figure in Flenders region as the Count of Boulogne until he died in 1087 possibly of old age at around 70 years old.",,,,,,,

William and along with his father participated in the Council at Lillebonne and contributed around 80 transport ships to the invasion fleet. Although not explicitly mentioned, it was very likely that William also fought in the Battle of Hastings.","With the retirement of his father in 1066, William succeeded as the Count of Évreux the next year after the invasion. He was modestly rewarded with chiefdoms in England for his contribution probably due to his young age compared to the other companions. After the invasion, William also participated in many other battles and conflicts including the 1088 rebellion on the side of William II of England. His name was also recorded in the Battle of Tinchebray in 1106 fighting for King Henry I as well.","In the later part of his life, his wife, Hervise of Nevers who is the daughter of William the Conqueror, became the regent and ruled in his place. Her rule was reportedly efficient yet too audacious that William II exiled both William and his wife twice, both times due to the complaints by his own noble council. William died in 1118 at the age of around 70 years old and was buried in Fontenelle Abbey, Normandy, next to his father's grave. As he died childlessly, all of his possessions were seized by Henry I to prevent foreign inheritance by his French relative.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,"Robert de Beaumont, born between 1040 and 1050, was the son of Roger de Beaumont and Adeline de Meulan. No record of his achievement and early part of his life is known until his contribution in the Battle of Hastings where he personally fought under William of Normandy. He was the commander of the French infantry regiment on the right side of the army during the battle. He was rewarded for his accomplishment in battle with many English Manors in Warwickshire and Leicestershire.","He inherited Count of Meulan from his mother in 1081, he also inherited many titles and properties in the Frech region in the same year. In 1107, Henry I of England created the title of Earl of Leicester and granted the title to Robert, making him the first Earl of Leicester in history, which would be inherited by his family for generations to come. Later on, Robert was excommunicated by Pope Paschal II in 1105 for his role in investiture (instalment freedom of bishop by the state/king instead of the Pope) in England.","Robert was the last living Norman noble that fought in the Battle of Hastings to die in 1118 at the age of around 70 years old. The cause of death is not known but the story is that he died of shame for having the woman he fancied stolen by another nobleman. He was buried at Préaux Abbey and his son, Robert II inherited the title of Earl of Leicester and his other titles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,"Geoffrey II, son of Rotrou I and possibly Adeliza, was likely born between 1030 to 1040 by the estimation of his death in 1100.

Not much else is known about his early life and his contribution to the invasion but he was rewarded with a great amount of landholding in England. ","After becoming the Count, Geoffrey began the act to reform Saint-Denis of Nogent-le-Rotrou abbey's monastery to improve its monastic standard. Geoffrey also reputedly began a conflict with Robert of Belleme, his relative and a powerful Norman noble, over a failed land dispute. A historical account of Geoffrey's character seems to be that he is a handsome and brave leader with a strong religious belief. Geoffrey later focused his life in religious pursuit and built a leper colony in his domain.","Geoffrey died in 1100 while his son, Rotrou II, was on the journey for the First Crusade. During Rotrou absence, Geoffrey's wife, Beatrix, became the regent for an unknown period of time. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aimery also participated in the Reconquista against the Moors and participate in the Crusade of Barbastro, sanctioned by Pope Alexander.","Aimery joined William of Normandy in the Invasion of England in 1066 and commanded the Breton contingent on the left wing during the Battle of Hastings. After the successful invasion, he received great wealth as a reward and returned to France.

The norman chronicle wrote that the William of Normandy gave the corpse of Harold Godwinson to William Malet after the battle for the burial ceremony. Harold's corpse was temporarily buried at the cliff near Hastings. William was rewarded handsomely after the battle with new titles and lands.","IMAGE:\data\ruleset\historical\leader\lore_image\malet_1.png","Picture: Malet House’s coat of arms in Iddesleigh Parish Church.","William was granted a large part of the land in Suffolk and Norfolk where he built a Motte and Bailey castle to be his new headquarters. Like many other Motte, there are no longer the remains of William's castle left standing in the present day. He was later appointed the first High Sheriff of Yorkshire after the Siege of York in 1068 and was the commander in the defence against Danish Vikings in the later years. He and his family were taken hostage by the Vikings.","He and his family were later released from captivity and safely returned to their holding. William was later appointed High Sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk by William the Conqueror as a reward for the contribution in defending against the Danish invasion. William died at some point before the Domesday Book survey in 1084 and his son, Robert, inherited his title and wealth.",,,,,,,,,,

Being half-brother to William makes Odo, one of the most prominent companions of William throughout his life. Not much else is known about the activities in his early life, he was a Christian cleric and became bishop of Bayeux in 1049. He was the main figure who participate in the war council for the invasion of England and served as the closest advisor to William.","IMAGE:\data\ruleset\historical\leader\lore_image\odo_1.png","    ","Picture: Odo during the discussion with William and Robert regarding the building of motte base of operation after the invasion landing. ","After the war Council of Lillebonne, Odo contributed to the invasion preparation and accompanied William throughout the invasion. He also participated in the Battle of Hastings, leading the Breton contingents on the left side of the army. As a cleric, his presence alone may already boost the morale of the troop significantly, with the affirmation that the church and no doubt, God, are on their side. If the Tapestry is to be believed, Odo personally fought in the battle along with his men.","IMAGE:\data\ruleset\historical\leader\lore_image\odo_2.png","                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Picture: Odo in the Battle of Hastings equipped with a wooden club and rallying his troops.","Victorious from the battle and ultimately the invasion, Odo received a major portion of the war spoils and rewards. He was made the Earl of Kent and controlled the southeast region of the country. During William the conqueror's reign, Odo was the second in power who assist William in court and even served as regent during William's absence. His vast amount of wealth and estates was only second to the king himself.","It is commonly believed that the Bayeux Tapestry was commissioned by Odo to lavishly decorate his cathedral roughly a decade after the invasion. This may explain the mysterious appearance of the three individuals namely, Wadard, Vital and Turold the dwarf servant who were Odo's tenants. The growth of Odo's power and influence came to the abrupt end when William began to view Odo's vast political influence as a threat to his rule.","IMAGE:\data\ruleset\historical\leader\lore_image\odo_3.png","                       ","Picture: Turold the dwarf holding a horse in the Bayeux Tapestry","Odo was subjected to two separate imprisonments on the order of William for different charges in 1076 and 1082, both of which caused great loss to his wealth, title, and his formal perceived authority. There can be no doubt that both Odo and William no longer viewed the another with flavour. After being in prison for around five years in Normandy, William, now on his deathbed, released Odo from prison after being persuaded by Robert, Count of Mortain in 1087.","After William's death, Odo supported William's eldest son, Robert Curthose, in the succession rebellion along with Robert, Count of Mortain. The rebellion failed in the end and Odo with permission of William Rufus was allowed to leave England and continued serving Robert Curthose in Normandy. Later in his life, Odo participated in the First Crusade alongside Robert Curthose. His travel came to an end abrupt on the way to Italy with his death, possibly from old age in his 60s.

17,"Turstin Fitz Rolf (Son of Rolf) or Turstin the White was born around 1045 in Bec-de-Mortagne, Normandy. There is not much information regarding his family as we only know that his father name was Rolf as the name of Turstin suggested. Not much else is known about his early life, except that he was a knight under William of Normandy. He was one of the minor nobles that participated in the Invasion of England, either to serve his lord or for wealth and glory.","The story went that as the two formally selected knights, namely Raoul II of Tosny and Walter Giffard, rejected Duke William's offer for the standard-bearer, William called upon Turstin to offer the position. Turstin gladly accepted and bear the standard, which as claimed by the Norman sources was provided by the Pope. This means that Turstin would carry the standard throughout the Battle of Hastings nearby Duke William and may even engage in combat with the enemy if the chronicle of William's personal combat to be believed.","IMAGE:\data\ruleset\historical\leader\lore_image\eustace_1.png","Picture: Knight in the Bayeux Tapestry that some consider depicting Turstin as he holds a standard in his hand. Although it is more likely to be Eustace II.","For accomplishing such prestige purpose, Turstin was rewarded with manors around England and the title of Baron of North Cadbury. No tale was written of his deed after the invasion nor his family line, most of the lands that he held seem to be passed on to other families for an unknown reason after his death at some time after 1086.

18,"Geoffrey de Montbray was born around 1030 in Montbray, Normandy. He was the son of Roger de Montbray and an unnamed mother. He was made Bishop of Coutances by his brother, Mauger de Montbray, Archbishop of Rouen, in 1049 at age 19 years old. To the surprise of nobody, Geoffrey was accused of simony (buying the bishop title) by the Council of Reims. He had to testimony before Pope Leo IX in that same year and with a skilful speech, Pope Leo IX declared Geoffrey innocence of such crime.","After the council, Geoffrey accompanied the pope for about a year and attended the council at Rome in 1050 and personally signed the decree (papal bull) that declares Bishop Gerard of Toul as a saint. During his stay in Italy, there are numerous records of Geoffrey meeting with several prominence church officials and nobles, including the infamous Norman adventurer, Robert Guiscard, who conquered Sicily from the occupied Muslims.","Returning from Italy, Geoffrey began the restoration of religious buildings and faith including enacting a new cathedral in his region. Since the beginning of his career, Geoffrey was involved in the political matter in Normandy as well. He was personally close to Duke William of Normandy and help advise in the matter of state multiple times. This is not to say that he disregarded his duty in the spiritual and religious matter though. And in 1066, he accompanied William in his conquest of England.","For commanding the troops in the Battle of Hastings, Geoffrey was rewarded with a great number of lands across England. Even after the invasion, Geoffrey remained a charismatic aristocrat in William's court and actively participated in the political activity of England under William's rule. Moreover, he was also quite active in the matter of warfare, Geoffrey was presented in the siege of Montacute castle in 1069, 1075 rebellion suppression and even joined Robert de Montbray in the succession rebellion.","Although his name was presented in various battles, it was uncertain what was his role in the army or battle. Some records suggest that he and a group of clerics offered a prayer to the troops before the battles. He also served as the advisor to the commander and very likely to directly participated in the combat. Surprisingly, no record of his name was found to hold any title in England after the invasion. This may indicate that Geoffrey remained simply a close advisor for William throughout his rule.","This warrior bishop was one of the leaders in the failed succession rebellion in 1088. After Bishop Odo of Bayeux surrendered to King William II, Geoffrey seemed to manage to reconcile with William rather quickly and fortunately secured all of his wealth and land in England. Although this reconciliation may come at a cost, as his activity in Normandy dwindled significantly in the later years, indicating that Robert Curthose no longer view Geoffrey with favour and the two became hostile.","No longer a prominent figure in both Normandy and England, Geoffrey remained a wealthy individual and still tried to facilitate the matter between both sides as Geoffrey was likely to be presented during the formal peace treaty between William and Robert in Normandy. In 1091, an earthquake stuck Coutances and was famously interpreted as an omen for Geoffrey's death. Geoffrey suddenly fell ill with stomach pain shortly after and was completely incapacitated by the pain.","After recovering from such illness, Geoffrey organised a public confession for his sins and gave alms to the poor. He also ordered the repair for his church and cathedral, while also organised the curse cleansing. Such event was witnessed by many prominent people such as Bishop Odo of Bayeux and Bishop William of Durham. In 1092, Geoffrey died in his deathbed surrounded by clerics and other people. A funeral was performed and his body was buried in his churchyard.",,,,,,,,

25,"Harold II of house Godwinson was born in 1022, son of Godwin of Wessex and Gytha. House Godwinson was already one of the most powerful families in England, controlling the majority of the south-eastern part of the country.  In 1044, his father obtained and bestowed the Earldom of East Angelia to him. Harold also married Edith the Fair at around this time, the marriage was considered to be controversial as many scholars still debated whether the church considered it to be illegitimate or not.","In 1051, Harold's father rebelled against Edward the Confessor for refusing to obey the royal decree to punish the people of Dover who attack Eustace II during his visit. The rebellion failed and his whole family was exiled from England in the same year. Harold and his younger brother, Leofwine, fled to Dublin while the rest of the family sought refuge in Flender. A year later, Harold and his family returned to England with an army and forced Edward to restore the lost earldom to his father, thus restoring the power of Godwinson.","After his father died suddenly in 1053, Harold inherit the Earldom of Wessex and became the most powerful political figure in England, second only to the king himself. In 1057, the death of Leofric and other political rivals allowed Harold to obtained the Earldom of Mercia and Northumbria for his two younger brothers. Godwinson family was no doubt the most powerful house in Saxon England at the time. Even more so as Harold also strengthen the alliance with other powerful Saxon nobles.","Harold also emerge victorious against the Welsh multiple times both in defensive and offensive campaigns, which strengthened his political position even further. In 1064, the Norman chronicle recounted that Harold was sent by Edward to inform William the Bastard of the decision to make William the King of England. The ship Harold was on then got shipwrecked and he got captured by William's vassal. Harold was later released and welcomed by William at the Normandy's court.","With Edward’s death In 1066, Harold claimed that Edward on his deathbed appointed Harold as the ""protector"" of the kingdom. Harold was then elected as King in the noble council meeting the following day after. Soon after the news of coronation spread, William and  Harald III Hardraade of Norway began planning their own invasions to claim the throne for themselves. Moreover, his previously exiled brother, Tostig Godwinson, also started the rebellion for revenge in the north.","IMAGE:\data\ruleset\historical\leader\lore_image\harold_1.png","                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Picture above: Harold swore his fealty and pledged his support to William's inheritance for King of England after his release.

Before Harald Hardrada's force arrived, Tostig move his raiding target to the northern part of the country. While, Harold still positioned his army in the southern part waiting for William's force to arrived. With the news that Tostig and Harald joined forced, captured York and defeated a local army in the Battle of Fulford, Harold rushed his army up north from London.","Harold's army marched to Yorkshire in 4 days and caught Harald and Tostig' combined force by surprise at Stamford Bridge. According to a Norwegian source, Harold himself rode to Harld and Tostig alone before the battle to convince Tostig to return to his side. The battle began with the English army attempting to cross the bridge, while the Norwegian force start preparing for battle and a lone Norse warrior single-handedly delay the English crossing.","When the English managed to cross the bridge, only a portion of the Norse army managed to form a shield wall and most of them left their armour behind. The battle consisted of the two forces locking in a shield wall engagement for hours. With massive disadvantage, the Norse infantries broke first with both Harald and Tostig killed in the battle subsequently. Although the Norse reinforcement managed to arrive before the battle ended, they were of not much help and could not change the outcome of the battle. ","Although victorious, Harold needed to march his army to the south to fight against the second invasion force led by William. The forced march was so taxing that a good portion of the army was left behind on the way. Upon reaching Hastings, Harold camped his force at Caldbec Hill and his troops held a feast for an entire night to prepare for the upcoming battle. In the early morning, Harold marched his force with the plan to catch William's army off-guard similar to the prior battle but failed. The Battle of Hastings commenced and ended with his death.
