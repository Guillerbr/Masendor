2,"William of house Normandy, an illegitimate son of Robert I the Magnificent (hence the nickname “the Bastard”), was born around 1027. He became the Duke of Normandy at the age of 8 but his rise was nothing short of challenging due to his birth status. Many nobles attempted to gain custody of the young duke or organise rebellions to seize the dukedom. With the support of King Henry I of France and many prominent nobles, William managed to consolidate the region of Normandy under his rule in the end.","William first experience in warfare began in the Battle of Varaville, 1047, against a rebellion led by Guy of Burgundy and the fellow conspirators. With the support of King Henry I who personally raised an army of 10,000 strongs to support William's much smaller army, they managed to win against the less organised rebel army, while being outnumbered by at least 2 to 1. The battle ended prematurely after the rebel army became disheartened after losing multiple cavalry skirmishes and broken apart.","After crushing the rebels in the Battle of Varaville, William continuously removed those who threaten his rule in a series of battles and sieges. After his rule of Normandy was firmly in place, William never stop expanding his influence, which ultimately caused great concern to both the French King, Henry I, and his court. Thus, Henry I and multiple French and Norman nobles marched to seize control of Normandy. Two invasions were attempted which result in the Battle of Mortemer in 1054 and Battle of Varaville in 1057.","With Normandy now under his control, William expanded his control even further with the Invasion of Brittany in 1064, only two years before the England invasion. Although the exact purpose of this invasion is not recorded, William managed to secure the border and also gained many Breton allies who will assist in the upcoming invasion. Additionally, it is with this invasion that multiple Norman sided sources claim Harold Godwinson assisted William in the invasion and promised to help him secure the throne of England.","Edward the Confessor recently passed away in 1066 and Harold proclaimed himself as King of England. William, who also claim to receive such blessing from King Edward, prepared an invasion to claim his rightful throne. Two war councils were called to plan the invasion and multiple prominent rulers at the time seem to support the invasion including the pope himself. William's army was assembled and the fleet was constructed in Normandy. ","Interestingly, the initial beginning of the invasion did not go well, the strong wind caused a major delay to the invasion, loss of fleet portion and decrease in the morale. This misfortune, however, creates a significant adventurous turn of event for William as King Harald of Norway arrived a few days earlier at Northumbrian coast. This cause Harold to march his army up north to deal with the Norwegian invasion and allows William's force to land safely at Pevensey Bay with plenty of time to recuperate.","IMAGE:\data\ruleset\historical\leader\lore_image\william_1.png","                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Picture: William holding a feast after fleet landing.","In the Battle of Hastings, William positioned his Conroi knights contingent behind the frontline during the initial phase of the battle. It is very likely that in the melee phase in mid-day that he personally led the charge into the enemy infantry line. If the chronicle to be believed, William was unhorsed and almost got killed multiple times in battle, which can be the cause of rumour of his death among the troop. At the end of the day, William managed to win against all odds and came out victorious. ","IMAGE:\data\ruleset\historical\leader\lore_image\william_2.png","Picture: William in battle openning his                                        helmet to prove that he was still alive                                       and rally his men.","After the battle, William marched his army to London while also spreading his force to crush the remaining Saxon resistance around the country. Upon reaching London, William ordered the construction of the Tower of London to fortified the capital. He was coronated as the king of England at Westminster Abbey on Christmas day 1066.  The English throne would then no longer be a dream but a reality. Thus marked the end of Saxon influence in England and the Norman conquest.","With William as now king, he replaced the old Saxon law and culture with the Norman one. Many former Saxon nobles were replaced with those who accompanied William in the invasion. Unsurprisingly, many remaining Saxon nobles would continue the resistance for the years to come. Even worse, King Sweyn II of Denmark supported the rebellion and mobilised his army for invasion. The resistance would continue for no less than two more decades after the end of conquest.","William's ruling over England is not much different from his prior approach in Normandy. The constant internal conflicts, rebellion and left the country in a constant state of warfare. Not only that, many of his campaigns were considered to be genocidal in nature by many scholars today, though not really uncommon in the Medieval era. Nevertheless, his military achievement is no doubt one of the deservingly critical acclaimed by historians today.","His story did not conclude elegantly even in his death. His lifeless body went rotten before the burial ceremony, and it swelled up to the point that it exploded when stuffed inside the coffin. His throne also did not pass on peacefully for succession rebellion between his two sons occurred only one year after, and the rule of his son (Rufus, the one who won) too ended tragically with an arrow to the chest.",

Being half-brother to William makes Odo, one of the most prominent companions of William throughout his life. Not much else is known about the activities in his early life, he was a Christian cleric and became bishop of Bayeux in 1049. He was the main figure who participate in the war council for the invasion of England and served as the closest advisor to William.","IMAGE:\data\ruleset\historical\leader\lore_image\odo_1.png","Picture: Odo during the discussion with William and Robert regarding the building of motte base of operation after the invasion landing. ","After the war Council of Lillebonne, Odo contributed to the invasion preparation and accompanied William throughout the invasion. He also participated in the Battle of Hastings, leading the Breton contingents on the left side of the army. As a cleric, his presence alone may already boost the morale of the troop significantly, with the affirmation that the church and no doubt, God, are on their side. If the Tapestry is to be believed, Odo personally fought in the battle along with his men.","IMAGE:\data\ruleset\historical\leader\lore_image\odo_2.png","Picture: Odo in the Battle of Hastings equipped with a wooden club and rallying his troops.","Victorious from the battle and ultimately the invasion, Odo received a major portion of the war spoils and rewards. He was made the Earl of Kent and controlled the southeast region of the country. During William the conqueror's reign, Odo was the second in power who assist William in court and even served as regent during William's absence. His vast amount of wealth and estates was only second to the king himself.","It is commonly believed that the Bayeux Tapestry was commissioned by Odo to lavishly decorate his cathedral roughly a decade after the invasion. This may explain the mysterious appearance of the three individuals namely, Wadard, Vital and Turold the dwarf servant who were Odo's tenants. The growth of Odo's power and influence came to the abrupt end when William began to view Odo's vast political influence as a threat to his rule.","IMAGE:\data\ruleset\historical\leader\lore_image\odo_3.png","Picture: Turold the dwarf holding a horse in the Bayeux Tapestry","Odo was subjected to two separate imprisonments on the order of William for different charges in 1076 and 1082, both of which caused great loss to his wealth, title, and his formal perceived authority. There can be no doubt that both Odo and William no longer viewed the another with flavour. After being in prison for around five years in Normandy, William, now on his deathbed, released Odo from prison after being persuaded by Robert, Count of Mortain in 1087.","After William's death, Odo supported William's eldest son, Robert Curthose, in the succession rebellion along with Robert, Count of Mortain. The rebellion failed in the end and Odo with permission of William Rufus was allowed to leave England and continued serving Robert Curthose in Normandy. Later in his life, Odo participated in the First Crusade alongside Robert Curthose. His travel came to an end abrupt on the way to Italy with his death, possibly from old age in his 60s.

25,"Harold II of house Godwinson was born in 1022, son of Godwin of Wessex and Gytha. House Godwinson was already one of the most powerful families in England, controlling the majority of the south-eastern part of the country.  In 1044, his father obtained and bestowed the Earldom of East Angelia to him. Harold also married Edith the Fair at around this time, the marriage was considered to be controversial as many scholars still debated whether the church considered it to be illegitimate or not.","In 1051, Harold's father rebelled against Edward the Confessor for refusing to obey the royal decree to punish the people of Dover who attack Eustace II during his visit. The rebellion failed and his whole family was exiled from England in the same year. Harold and his younger brother, Leofwine, fled to Dublin while the rest of the family sought refuge in Flender. A year later, Harold and his family returned to England with an army and forced Edward to restore the lost earldom to his father, thus restoring the power of Godwinson.","After his father died suddenly in 1053, Harold inherit the Earldom of Wessex and became the most powerful political figure in England, second only to the king himself. In 1057, the death of Leofric and other political rivals allowed Harold to obtained the Earldom of Mercia and Northumbria for his two younger brothers. Godwinson family was no doubt the most powerful house in Saxon England at the time. Even more so as Harold also strengthen the alliance with other powerful Saxon nobles.","Harold also emerge victorious against the Welsh multiple times both in defensive and offensive campaigns, which strengthened his political position even further. In 1064, the Norman chronicle recounted that Harold was sent by Edward to inform William the Bastard of the decision to make William the King of England. The ship Harold was on then got shipwrecked and he got captured by William's vassal. Harold was later released and welcomed by William at the Normandy's court.","With Edward’s death In 1066, Harold claimed that Edward on his deathbed appointed Harold as the ""protector"" of the kingdom. Harold was then elected as King in the noble council meeting the following day after. Soon after the news of coronation spread, William and  Harald III Hardraade of Norway began planning their own invasions to claim the throne for themselves. Moreover, his previously exiled brother, Tostig Godwinson, also started the rebellion for revenge in the north.","IMAGE:\data\ruleset\historical\leader\lore_image\harold_1.png","Picture: Harold swore his fealty and pledged his support to William's inheritance for King of England after his release.","IMAGE:\data\ruleset\historical\leader\lore_image\harold_2.png","Picture: Harold being crowned King of England at Winchester Abbey by the archbishop of York.","Harold managed to fended off Tostig’s initial raids on mutiple regions of England. Before Harald Hardrada's force arrived, Tostig move his raiding target to the northern part of the country. While, Harold still positioned his army in the southern part waiting for William's force to arrived. With the news that Tostig and Harald joined forced, captured York and defeated a local army in the Battle of Fulford, Harold rushed his army up north from London.","Harold's army marched to Yorkshire in 4 days and caught Harald and Tostig' combined force by surprise at Stamford Bridge. According to a Norwegian source, Harold himself rode to Harld and Tostig alone before the battle to convince Tostig to return to his side. The battle began with the English army attempting to cross the bridge, while the Norwegian force start preparing for battle and a lone Norse warrior single-handedly delay the English crossing.","When the English managed to cross the bridge, only a portion of the Norse army managed to form a shield wall and most of them left their armour behind. The battle consisted of the two forces locking in a shield wall engagement for hours. With massive disadvantage, the Norse infantries broke first with both Harald and Tostig killed in the battle subsequently. Although the Norse reinforcement managed to arrive before the battle ended, they were of not much help and could not change the outcome of the battle. ","Although victorious, Harold needed to march his army to the south to fight against the second invasion force led by William. The forced march was so taxing that a good portion of the army was left behind on the way. Upon reaching Hastings, Harold camped his force at Caldbec Hill and his troops held a feast for an entire night to prepare for the upcoming battle. In the early morning, Harold marched his force with the plan to catch William's army off-guard similar to the prior battle but failed. The Battle of Hastings commenced and ended with his death.
