The perfection of quality comes not only from pure talent but also thousand hours of hard-working practice. His arts were even praised by the dwarf craftsmen, something that no human ever have the grace to ever receive it. "
4,"Jonas Elbadai",100,86,4,8,3,4,8,14,4,,1,"The world is not only made of black and white. It existed in many shades of colour, maybe even the colours we can never see. So does a person and his or her characteristics. But must so-called characteristic be constant? What would happen if a person can change his personality in the matter of friction of a second? Not simply faking it but completely alters it at the very core to become a completely new identity. Can such a thing even be called person anymore or it becomes something incomprehensible entirely? "

He does not take kindly to deception and will swiftly cut down anyone whom he thinks has wronged him. Despite being a warrior, Orsanoas does not flavour wearing any armour of sort. His favourite weapon seems to be a giant swordstaff named ""Aetel""."

Despite his talent and ingenious rulership, he just simply cannot overcome his extraordinarily bad luck. His country will fall to ruin no matter what he accomplishes as he can only delay the inevitable and he himself aware of such fact.
