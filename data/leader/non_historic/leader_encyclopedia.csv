1,,"The portrait displays the moment before Remance ordered for the charge of his personally trained cavalry units, Malebels, against the battalion of Emadshu Star Makers orc units. The dust from horses galloping and orcs stomping became so thick that no one in that battlefield can see what is going on. In the moment of confusion, Remance and his troops managed to charge through the entire orc army as they can not even muster any decent defence against something they cannot even see until the final fraction of a second. At the end of the day, his unthinkable victory against this infamous orc army landed him a Barony of Salenkes and a title of Lion General, which opening up his path to legend."

4,,"This is the exact moment when Vars is about to get beaten of his life by Aunnial the Holy Maiden in the Masendor invasion of Valle after hearing the rumour about the unbeatable holy maiden. Underneath the clothes, Vars with at least 20 grade S (according to him since no one really grades cursed items) cursed items that normally would kill anyone who wears them reduce his strength down to at a superhuman level. He is also accompanied by an army of witches and dark wizards he recruited (forcefully) to perform curse magic on him to reduce his strength even further. Although lost consecutively for 6 six days, his abnormal growth manages to surpass Aunnial whom being supported by the physical strengthen magic from the whole nation. A challenge he will never face again for the unforeseeable future end disappointingly for him. "
5,,"The portrait shows Orsanoas being swung (willingly) by fellow Brothers of Kolinkeus to relieve his anger of being cheated in a duel. This is a popular traditional activity called ""Ekkutukai"" (Tossing anger) among Kolinkeus Practitioners where 2 of the strongest Brothers (or Sisters) of Kolinkeus grab the hands of the angry requestor and start swinging him as fast as possible (thinks of teacup carousel for real-life comparison) while the requestor loudly yells out his anger. The act usually ends by tossing the person into a lake as it is quite difficult to cease the momentum properly without injury. This tradition was invented by some Kolinkeus genius a few centuries ago who discover that such an act is not only undeniably enjoyable but can also be used to demonstrate the strength of the practitioners."

Little did Sasinola knew that the butterfly creature annoyingly sprinkling purple dust on her is called Lokhuticse (Marked of Death) that have mutualism symbiotic relationship with another creature called Akashijus (Hidden Bear). Lokhuticse is a carnivorous insect that eats the remains corpse of Akashijus's prey. It assists Akashijus's olfactory perception by sprinkling its dust on the target that Akashijus can smell from miles away. Akashijus will then stalk the unaware prey until it is sure that the hunt can be performed safely without a competitor. Luckily, the cowardly Sasinola is not without prepared as the drug she created works as a countermeasure against many creatures including Akashijus."

46,,"Being a master of life magic, Sonagsha often detaches and plays with her own bodyparts out of boredom beside reading the tiny books dangle from her hat. Aside from serving as a time-killing activity, she sometimes performs such an act to entertain or scare off people she found annoying.  These people are considered to be fortunate examples as she typically lures and dismantles unsuspecting people with her deceptive childlike appearance for her research. At the end of the day, never approach a child walking around alone be it in the town or forest since nothing good will ever come out of such encounter.   "
