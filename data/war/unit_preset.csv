Lancers are the solution to counter the dominance of cavalry by being the better offensive cavalry themselves. Bearing a long lance, Lancers' charge is much more devastating than other heavy cavalry units. However, they are much less effective in melee combat making them more suitable as shock cavalry rather than primary melee cavalry."

Unmatched in the flat plain even by the heavy knights who dominate the age-old battlefield. Mounted Archers are the first glimpse into the new era of warfare where speed decide the victor. Mounted Archers unequally excel in skirmish tactics. Very few units can match the speed of Mount Archers and can engage them in melee combat. When facing against such foes, bait them into unsuitable terrain that reduces their speed and decimate them before they can retreat."

Additionally, camel also has a peculiar smell that horse dislike and render them less effective in battle this makes Camel Riders an effective cavalry and anti-cavalry unit at the same time. "
