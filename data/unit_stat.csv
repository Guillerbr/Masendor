Although also existed in a smaller form, Pole Bill was a popular weapon in the European middle age that share similar purpose as halberd and other glaive type weapons. Effective for both long-range piercing and slashing manoeuvres, while being lightweight makes Billhook much more flexible and easier to adapt than other polearms. As a result, Billmen is positively versatile polearm unit that exudes almost no apparent weakness."
